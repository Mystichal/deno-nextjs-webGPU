# <Deno-NextJS-WebGPU-Boilerplate>

## Description

I wanted to test WebGPU as a renderer for a 3D game engine, and NextJS as a framework for the game engine.The purpose was to get better fps on lower end computers, mostly cards missing raytracing capabilities. I learnt alot about Blender and how to do animations as well as how to setup Deno with NextJS.
